# Social(fx)

Social(fx) is a MERN application that allows users to simplify their event planning process. Users are able to log in and view all events, create their own events, and delete the event if needed. When creating an event, users can include a description, a picture (not required), their guest list, activities, food, and any supplies the event needs. Guests can comment on the event what they plan to bring or if they have any input to help with the planning process!
