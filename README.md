# Social(fx)

Social(fx) is a MERN application that allows users to simplify their event planning process. Users are able to log in and view all events, create their own events, and delete the event if needed. When creating an event, users can include a description, a picture (not required), their guest list, activities, food, and any needed supplies. Guests can comment what they're bringing to the event or if they have any input to help with the planning process!
